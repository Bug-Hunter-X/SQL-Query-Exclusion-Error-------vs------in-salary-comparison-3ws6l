This repository demonstrates a common SQL error where using the '>' operator instead of '>=' in a WHERE clause can lead to unintended data exclusion. The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query, and `bugSolution.sql` provides the corrected version.  The issue is subtle, especially when dealing with financial data where precise thresholds are crucial.
